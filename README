released under GPL

Demo
http://www.cse.sc.edu/~zhou42/data/GMView/GMView.html

Usage
You need to provide text files describing graphs and the match:
00.V     graph vertex coordinates in the 1st graph
01.V     graph vertex coordinates in the 2nd graph
00.E     graph edges in the 1st graph
01.E     graph edges in the 2nd graph
00-01.M  matched vertexes in the 2nd graph
         for vertexes in the 1st graph

Then click Go, vertex labels will be shown in both graphs.
Red labels means unmatched vertexes in the 1st graph.
Blue labels means unmatched vertexes in the 2nd graph.

Single left-click on labels will highlight matched vertexes in another graph.
Double left-click on images will remove the highlight.

Click on 'Show Edges' will show graph edges in both graphs.

To visualize your own images, please modify the <img> tags in
GMView.html directly.
