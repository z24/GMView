Graph Match Viewer: Visualize Graph Matching

released under GPL

Demo
http://www.cse.sc.edu/~zhou42/data/GMView/GMView.html

Usage
You need to provide three text files (I use demo files as examples):
00.xy               graph vertex coordinates for the 1st graph
01.xy               graph vertex coordinates for the 2nd graph
00-01-n10-d80.M     matched vertexes in the 2nd graph
                    for vertexes in the 1st graph

Then click Go, vertex labels will be shown in both graphs.
Red labels means unmatched vertexes in the 1st graph.
Blue labels means unmatched vertexes in the 2nd graph.

Single left-click on labels will highlight matched vertexes in another graph.
Double left-click on images will remove the highlight.

To visualize your own images, please modify the <img> tags in
GMView.html directly.
